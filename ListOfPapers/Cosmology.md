- <mark>Silveravalle 2025</mark> (NaP^[1]): Cosmology with a Non-minimally Coupled Dark Matter Fluid I. Background Evolution

	- We explore a cosmological model in which dark matter is non-minimally coupled to gravity at the fluid level. 
	- While typically subdominant compared to Standard Model forces, such couplings may dominate dark matter dynamics. We show that this interaction **modifies the early-time Friedmann equations**, driving a phase of accelerated expansion that can **resolve the horizon and flatness problems without introducing additional fields**. 
	- At even earlier times, the coupling to spatial curvature may give rise to a **cosmological bounce**, replacing the initial singularity of standard cosmology. These results suggest that non-minimally coupled dark matter could offer a **unified framework for addressing both the singularity** and **fine-tuning problems**.

- <mark>Haghani 2024</mark>: The first variation of the matter energy-momentum tensor with respect to the metric, and its implications on modified gravity theories

	- The **1st order variation of the matter energy-momentum tensor** $T_{\mu\nu}$ with respect to the metric tensor $g_{\alpha\beta}$ plays an important role in **modified gravity** theories with geometry-matter coupling, and in particular in the $f(R,T)$ modified gravity theory. 
	- We obtain the expression of the variation $\delta T_{\mu\nu} /\delta g_{\alpha\beta}$ for the baryonic matter described by an equation given in a parametric form, with the basic thermodynamic variables represented by the particle number density, and by the specific entropy, respectively. 
	- The first variation of the matter energy-momentum tensor turns out to be **independent on the matter Lagrangian**, and can be expressed in terms of the pressure, the energy-momentum tensor itself, and the matter fluid four-velocity. We apply the obtained results for the case of the $f(R,T)$ gravity theory, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar, and $T$ is the trace of the matter energy-momentum tensor, which thus becomes a **unique theory**, also independent on the choice of the matter Lagrangian. 
	- A simple cosmological model, in which the **Hilbert-Einstein Lagrangian** is generalized through the addition of a term proportional to $T^n$ is considered in detail, and it is shown that it gives a **very good description of the observational values** of the Hubble parameter up to a redshift of $z \approx 2.5$

- <mark>Bernardo 2023</mark>: Dark energy by natural evolution: Constraining dark energy using Approximate Bayesian Computation

	- We look at dark energy from a **biology inspired viewpoint** by means of the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) and late time cosmological observations. 
	- We find that **dynamical dark energy** comes out on top, or in the ABC language **naturally selected**, over the standard ΛCDM cosmological scenario. We confirm this conclusion is robust to whether baryon acoustic oscillations and Hubble constant priors are considered. 
	- Our results show that the algorithm prefers low values of the Hubble constant, consistent or at least a few standard deviation away from the CMB estimate, regardless of the priors taken initially in each model. 
	- This supports the result of the traditional MCMC analysis and could be viewed as strengthening evidence for **dynamical dark energy being a more favorable model of late time cosmology**.

- <mark>Rubin 2013</mark> (PFS^[2]): The virialization density of peaks with general density profiles under spherical collapse

	- We calculate the **non-linear virialization density** $\Delta_c$ of halos under spherical collapse from peaks with an arbitrary initial and final density profile. This is in contrast to the standard calculation of $\Delta_c$ which assumes **top-hat profiles**. Given our formalism, the non-linear halo density can be calculated once the shape of the initial peak’s density profile and the shape of the virialized halo’s profile are provided. 
	- We solve for $\Delta_c$ for halos in an **Einstein de-Sitter** and **ΛCDM universe**. As examples, we consider power-law initial profiles as well as spherically averaged peak profiles calculated from the statistics of a Gaussian random field. 
	- We find that, depending on the profiles used, $\Delta_c$ is smaller by a factor of a few to as much as a factor of 10 as compared to the density given by the standard calculation ($\approx200$). Using our results, we show that, for halo finding algorithms that identify halos through an over-density threshold, the halo mass function measured from cosmological simulations can be enhanced at all halo masses by a factor of a few.
	- This difference could be important when using numerical simulations to assess the validity of analytic models of the halo mass function.

- <mark>Suto 2015</mark>: CONFRONTATION OF TOP-HAT SPHERICAL COLLAPSE AGAINST DARK HALOS FROM COSMOLOGICAL N-BODY SIMULATIONS

	- The top-hat spherical collapse model (TSC) is one of the most fundamental analytical frameworks to describe the **non-linear growth of cosmic structure**. TSC has motivated, and been widely applied in, various researches even in the current era of precision cosmology. While numerous studies exist to examine its validity against numerical simulations in a statistical fashion, there are few analyses to compare the TSC dynamics in an **individual object-wise basis**, which is what we attempt in the present paper. 
	- We extract $100$ halos at $z = 0$ from a cosmological N-body simulation according to the conventional TSC criterion for the spherical over-density. Then we trace back their spherical counter-parts at earlier epochs. Just prior to the turn-around epoch of the halos, **their dynamics is well approximated by TSC**, but their **turn-around epochs are systematically delayed** and the virial radii are larger by $\sim 20\%$ on average relative to the TSC predictions. 
	- We ﬁnd that this systematic deviation is mainly ascribed to the non-uniformity/inhomogeneity of dark matter density proﬁles and the non-zero velocity dispersions, **both of which are neglected in TSC**. In particular, the **inside-out-collapse** and **shell-crossing** of dark matter halos play an important role in generating the signiﬁcant velocity dispersion. The implications of the present result are brieﬂy discussed. 
	- Subject headings: cosmology; spherical collapse model; dark matter halo

- <mark>Grandón 2018</mark>: Exploring evidence of interaction between dark energy and dark matter

	- We use the latest observations on SNIa, H(z), BAO, $f_\text{gas}$ in clusters and CMB, to **constrain three models** showing an **explicit interaction between dark matter and dark energy**. 
	- In particular, we use the BOSS BAO measurements at $z ≃ 0.32, 0.57$ and $2.34$, using the full 2-dimensional constraints on the angular and line of sight BAO scale. We find that using all five observational probes together, **two of the interaction models show positive evidence** at more than $3 σ$. 
	- Although significant, further study is needed to establish this statement firmly. (chickens out at the last minute?)

- <mark>Giblin 2018</mark>: The Limited Accuracy of Linearized Gravity

	- Standard cosmological models rely on an approximate treatment of gravity, utilizing solutions of the linearized Einstein equations as well as physical approximations. In an era of precision cosmology, we should ask: are these approximate predictions sufficiently accurate for comparison to observations, and can we draw meaningful conclusions about properties of our Universe from them? In this work we examine the accuracy of linearized gravity in the presence of collisionless matter and a cosmological constant utilizing fully general relativistic simulations. We observe the gauge-dependence of corrections to linear theory, and note the amplitude of these corrections. For perturbations whose amplitudes are in line with expectations from the standard ΛCDM model, we find that the full, general relativistic metric is well-described by linear theory in Newtonian and harmonic gauges, while the metric in comoving-synchronous gauge is not. For the largest observed structures in our Universe, our results suggest that corrections to linear gravitational theory can reach or surpass the percent-level.

- <mark>Tian 2021</mark>: On the question of measuring spatial curvature in an inhomogeneous universe

	- The curvature of a spacetime, either in a topological sense, or averaged over super-horizon-sized patches, is often equated with the global curvature term that appears in Friedmann’s equation. In general, however, the Universe is inhomogeneous, and gravity is a nonlinear theory, thus any curvature perturbations violate the assumptions of the FLRW model; it is not necessarily true that local curvature, averaged over patches of constant-time surfaces, will reproduce the observational effects of global symmetry. Further, the curvature of a constant-time hypersurface is not an observable quantity, and can only be inferred indirectly. Here, we examine the behavior of curvature modes on hypersurfaces of an inhomogeneous spacetime non-perturbatively in a numerical relativistic setting, and how this curvature corresponds with that inferred by observers. We also note the point at which observations become sensitive to the impact of curvature sourced by inhomogeneities on inferred average properties, finding general agreement with past literature.

- <mark>Serrano 2023</mark>: Friedmann equations and cosmic bounce in a modified cosmological scenario

	- Derivation of modified Raychaudhuri and Friedmann equations from a phenomenological model of **quantum gravity** based on the **thermodynamics of spacetime**. Starting from general gravitational equations of motion which encode low-energy quantum gravity effects, we found its particular solution for homogenous and isotropic universes with standard matter content, obtaining a modified Raychaudhuri equation. 
	- Then, we imposed local energy conservation and used a perturbative treatment to derive a modified Friedmann equation. The modified evolution in the early universe we obtained suggests a replacement of the Big Bang singularity by a regular bounce. 
	- Lastly, we also briefly discuss the range of validity of the perturbative approach and its results.

- <mark>Farsi 2023</mark>: Evolution of Spherical Overdensities in Energy-Momentum-Squared Gravity

	- Employing the spherical collapse (SC) formalism, we investigate the **linear evolution of the matter overdensity** for **energy-momentum-squared gravity** (EMSG), which in practical phenomenological terms, one may imagine as an extension of the ΛCDM model of cosmology. The underlying model, while still having a cosmological constant, is a non-linear material extension of GR and includes correction terms that are dominant in the high-energy regime, the early universe.
	- Considering the FRW background in the presence of a cosmological constant, we find the effects of the modifications arising from EMSG on the growth of perturbations at the early stages of the universe. Considering both possible negative and positive values of the **model parameter of EMSG**, we discuss its role in the evolution of the matter density contrast and growth function in the level of linear perturbations. 
	- While EMSG leaves imprints distinguishable from ΛCDM, we find that the negative range of the ESMG model parameter is **not well-behaved**, indicating an anomaly in the parameter space of the model. In this regard, for the evaluation of the galaxy cluster number count in the framework of EMSG, we equivalently provide an analysis of the number count of the gravitationally collapsed objects (or the **dark matter halos**). 
	- We show that the galaxy cluster number count decreases compared to the ΛCDM model. In agreement with the hierarchical model of structure formation, in EMSG cosmology the **more massive structures are less abundant**, meaning that form at later times.

- <mark>Lucie-Smith 2018</mark>: Machine learning cosmological structure formation

	- We train a ML algorithm to learn cosmological structure formation from N-body simulations. The algorithm infers the **relationship between the initial conditions and the final dark matter haloes**, without the need to introduce approximate halo collapse models. 
	- We gain **insights into the physics driving halo formation** by evaluating the predictive performance of the algorithm when provided with different types of information about the local environment around dark matter particles. 
	- **The algorithm learns to predict whether or not dark matter particles will end up in haloes of a given mass range**, based on spherical overdensities. 
	- We show that the resulting predictions match those of spherical collapse approximations such as extended Press-Schechter theory. 
	- Additional information on the shape of the local gravitational potential is **not able to improve halo collapse predictions**; the linear density field contains sufficient information for the algorithm to also reproduce **ellipsoidal collapse** predictions based on the **Sheth-Tormen model**. 
	- We investigate the algorithm’s performance in terms of halo mass and radial position and perform **blind analyses on independent initial conditions realisations** to demonstrate the generality of our results.

- <mark>Riess 1998</mark>: Observational Evidence from Supernovae for an Accelerating Universe and a Cosmological Constant

	- We present spectral and photometric observations of 10 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the redshift range 0.16 ≤ z ≤ 0.62. The luminosity distances of these objects are determined by methods that employ relations between SN Ia luminosity and light curve shape. Combined with previous data from our High-Z Supernova Search Team, this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and a set of 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the following cosmological parameters: the Hubble constant ($H_0$), the mass density ($\Omega_M$), the cosmological constant (i.e., the vacuum energy density, $\Omega_\Lambda$), the deceleration parameter ($q_0$), and the dynamical age of the Universe ($t_0$). 
	- The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10% to 15% farther than expected in a low mass density ($\Omega_M=0.2$) Universe without a cosmological constant. 
	- Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously **favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant** (i.e., $\Omega_\Lambda>0$) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., $q_0<0$). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Ω M ≥ 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are statistically consistent with q 0 < 0 at the 2.8σ and 3.9σ confidence levels, and with $\Omega_\Lambda>0$ at the $3.0\sigma$ and $4.0\sigma$ confidence levels, for two different fitting methods respectively. 
	- Fixing a “minimal” mass density, $\Omega_M=0.2$, results in the weakest detection, Ω Λ > 0 at the 3.0σ confidence level from one of the two methods. For a flat-Universe prior ($\Omega_M$ + $\Omega_\Lambda$ = 1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Ω Λ > 0 at 7σ and 9σ formal significance for the two different fitting methods. A Universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., $\Omega_M=1$) is formally ruled out at the $7\sigma$ to $8\sigma$ confidence level for the two different fitting methods. 
	- We estimate the dynamical age of the Universe to be $14.2 \pm1.5$ Gyr including **systematic uncertainties in the current Cepheid distance scale**. 
	- We **estimate the likely effect of several sources of systematic error**, including: 
		- Progenitor and metallicity evolution
		- Extinction
		- Sample selection bias
		- Local perturbations in the expansion rate
		- Gravitational lensing
		- Sample contamination
		- Presently, none of these effects reconciles the data with $\Omega_\Lambda=0$ and $q_0\geq0$.

- <mark>Ávila 2025</mark>: Transverse BAO scale measurement at $z_\text{eff}= 1.725$ with the **SDSS** quasars catalog

	- Studying the **SDSS-DR16** quasar catalog, we detect a baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signal in the **two-point angular correlation function** with a [[statistical significance]] of **3σ**, at an effective redshift of $z_\text{eff}= 1.725$. Using a simple parameterization—comprising a polynomial plus a Gaussian function—we measure the transverse BAO scale as $θ_\text{BAO} = 1.928^\circ \pm 0.094^\circ$. This measurement is obtained from a narrow redshift shell, $z \in [1.72, 1.73]$ (i.e., ∆z = 0.01), **thin enough that projection-effect corrections are negligible**, making it only weakly dependent on the assumed [[fiducial]] cosmology. The only assumption adopted is isotropy in the computation of the correlation function, further ensuring that the result depends only weakly on specific cosmological-model hypotheses. 
	- We also investigate possible systematics that could affect the detection or significance of the BAO signal and find them to be subdominant or implausible. 
	- When combined with other transverse BAO measurements from the literature, our result shows **good concordance**—within the **1σ confidence level**—with the cosmological parameter values reported by the **Planck and DESI collaborations**. 
	- This new measurement of the transverse BAO scale, obtained from the SDSS quasar sample with minimal cosmological-model assumptions, provides an additional independent constraint for updated statistical studies aimed at probing the nature of dark energy.

- <mark>Villanueva 2015</mark>: The generalized Chaplygin–Jacobi gas

	- The present paper is devoted to find a new generalization of the generalized Chaplygin gas. Therefore, starting from the **Hubble parameter associated to the Chaplygin scalar field** and using some **elliptic identities**, the elliptic generalization is straightforward. 
	- Thus, all relevant quantities that drive inflation are calculated exactly. Finally, using the measurement on inflation from the Planck 2015 results, observational constraints on the parameters are given.
