- <mark>Castillo-Felisola 2024</mark>: A polynomial affine model of gravity: after ten years

	- The polynomial aﬃne model of gravity was proposed as an alternative to metric and metric-aﬃne gravitational models. What at the beginning was thought as a source of unpredictability, the presence of many terms in the action, turned out to be a milestone, since it contains all possible combinations of the ﬁelds compatible with the **covariance under diﬀeomorphisms**. 
	- We present a review of the advances in the analysis of the model after ten years of its proposal, and sketch the guideline of our future perspectives.

- <mark>Carballo-Rubio 2022</mark>: Unimodular Gravity vs General Relativity: A status report

	- Unimodular Gravity (UG) is an alternative to General Relativity (GR) which, however, is so closely related to the latter that one can wonder to what extent they are different. The different behavior of the cosmological constant in the semiclassical regimes of both frameworks suggests the possible existence of additional contrasting features. 
	- UG and GR are based on two different gauge symmetries: UG is based on **transverse diffeomorphisms** and **Weyl rescalings** (WTDiff transformations), whereas GR is based on the **full group of diffeomorphisms**. This difference is related to the existence of a fiduciary background structure, a fixed volume form, in UG theories. In this work we present an overview as complete as possible of situations and regimes in which one might suspect that some differences between these two theories might arise. This overview contains analyses in the classical, semiclassical, and quantum regimes. When a particular situation is well known we make just a brief description of its status. For situations less analyzed in the literature we provide here more complete analyses. Whereas some of these analyses are sparse through the literature, many of them are new. Apart from the completely different treatment they provide for the cosmological constant problem, our results uncover no further differences between them. 
	- We conclude that, to the extent that the technical naturalness of the cosmological constant is regarded as a fundamental open issue in modern physics, UG is preferred over GR since the cosmological constant is technically natural in the former.

- <mark>Barrera 2020</mark>: Vector modes in ΛCDM: the gravitomagnetic potential in dark matter haloes from relativistic N-body simulations

	- We investigate the transverse modes of the gravitational and velocity fields in ΛCDM, based on a high-resolution simulation performed using the AMR general-relativistic N-body code **GRAMSES**. 
	- We study the generation of vorticity in the dark matter velocity field at low redshift, providing fits to the shape and evolution of its **power spectrum over a range of scales**. By analysing the gravitomagnetic vector potential, which is absent in Newtonian simulations, in dark matter haloes with masses ranging from $∼10^{12.5} h^{-1} M_\text{sun}$ to $∼10^{15} h^{−1} M_\text{sun}$, we find that its magnitude correlates with the halo mass, peaking in the inner regions. Nevertheless, on average, its ratio against the scalar gravitational potential remains fairly constant, below percent level, decreasing roughly linearly with redshift and showing a weak dependence on halo mass. 
	- Furthermore, we show that the gravitomagnetic acceleration in haloes peaks towards the core and reaches almost $10^{−10} h \text{ cm}/s^2$ in the most massive halo of the simulation. However, regardless of the halo mass, the ratio between the gravitomagnetic force and the standard gravitational force is typically at around the $10^{−5}$ level inside the haloes, again without significant radius dependence. 
	- This result confirms that the **gravitomagnetic effects have negligible impact on structure formation**, even for the most massive structures, although its behaviour in low density regions remains to be explored. Likewise, the impact on observations remains to be understood in the future.

- <mark>Ilkhchi 2025</mark>: Thermodynamics of FLRW universe in Quadratic Gravity

	- Investigate the thermodynamic aspects of quadratic gravity in a D-dimensional FLRW universe. 
	- First, we derive the field equations and the effective energy-momentum tensor for quadratic gravity. Then, using these equations, we obtain the generalized Misner-Sharp energy within the framework of this model. We consider the thermodynamic behavior of the **apparent horizon** and derive the equations of state related to the pressure, temperature, and radius of the apparent horizon. Using the thermodynamic pressure, we obtain the critical points corresponding to **phase transitions**. 
	- We determine the critical temperature and critical radius in terms of model parameters, including the quadratic coupling and the cosmological constant. We also examine key thermodynamic quantities, such as Wald entropy, specific heat at constant pressure, enthalpy, Gibbs free energy. By examining the behavior of these quantities, we can gain insight into the thermodynamic stability of the quadratic gravity model. In particular, we find that quadratic terms change the stability conditions and can lead to new thermodynamic behaviors compared to GR.
